<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project
`thingsvision` is a Python package that let's you easily extract image representations from many state-of-the-art neural networks for computer vision. In a nutshell, you feed `thingsvision` with a directory of images and tell it which neural network you are interested in. `thingsvision` will then give you the  representation of the indicated neural network for each image so that you will end up with one feature vector per image. You can use these feature vectors for further analyses. We use the word `features` for short when we mean "image representation".

:rotating_light: Note: some function calls mentioned in the [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.679838/full) have been deprecated. To use this package successfully, exclusively follow this `README` and the [documentation](https://vicco-group.github.io/thingsvision/). :rotating_light:

<!-- Functionality -->
### :mechanical_arm: Functionality
With `thingsvision`, you can:
- extract features for any imageset from many popular networks.
- extract features for any imageset from your custom networks.
- extract features for >26,000 images from the [THINGS image database](https://osf.io/jum2f/).
- optionally turn off the standard center cropping performed by many networks before extracting features.
- extract features from HDF5 datasets directly (e.g. NSD stimuli)
- conduct basic Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) after feature extraction.
- perform Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to compare image features across model-module combinations.

<!-- Model collection -->
### :file_cabinet: Model collection
Neural networks come from different sources. With `thingsvision`, you can extract image representations of all models from:
- [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/0.8/models.html)
- [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications)
- [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models)
- `ssl` (Self-Supervised Learning Models)
  - `simclr-rn50`, `mocov2-rn50`, `jigsaw-rn50`, `rotnet-rn50`, `swav-rn50`, `pirl-rn50` (from [vissl](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vissl))
  - `barlowtwins-rn50`, `vicreg-rn50` (from [torch.hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/))
- [OpenCLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip)
- both original [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) variants (`ViT-B/32` and `RN50`)
- a few custom models (Alexnet, VGG-16, Resnet50, and Inception_v3) trained on [Ecoset](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2011417118) rather than ImageNet  and one Alexnet pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on [SalObjSub](https://cs-people.bu.edu/jmzhang/sos.html)
- each of the many [CORnet](https://github.com/dicarlolab/CORnet) versions<br>

<!-- Getting Started -->
## :running: Getting Started

<!-- Setting up your environment -->
### :computer: Setting up your environment
#### Working locally.
First, create a new `conda environment` with Python version 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 e.g. by using `conda`:

```bash
$ conda create -n thingsvision python=3.9
$ conda activate thingsvision
```

Then, activate the environment and simply install `thingsvision` via running the following `pip` command in your terminal.

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade thingsvision
$ pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```

#### Google Colab.
Alternatively, you can use Google Colab to play around with `thingsvision` by uploading your image data to Google Drive (via directory mounting).
You can find the jupyter notebook using `PyTorch` [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ViCCo-Group/thingsvision/blob/master/notebooks/pytorch.ipynb) and the `TensorFlow` example [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ViCCo-Group/thingsvision/blob/master/notebooks/tensorflow.ipynb).

<!-- Basic usage -->
### :mag: Basic usage

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)

`thingsvision` was designed to simplify feature extraction. If you have some folder of images (e.g., `./images`) and want to extract features for each of these images without opening a Jupyter Notebook instance or writing a Python script, it's probably easiest to use our CLI. The interface includes two options,

- `thingsvision show-model`
- `thingsvision extract-features`

Example calls might look as follows:

```bash
thingsvision show-model --model-name "alexnet" --source "torchvision"
thingsvision extract_features --image-root "./data" --model-name "alexnet" --module-name "features.10" --batch-size 32 --device "cuda" --source "torchvision" --file-format "npy" --out-path "./features"
```

See `thingsvision show-model -h` and `thingsvision extract-features -h` for a list of all possible arguments. Note that the CLI provides just the basic extraction functionalities but is probably enough for most users that don't want to dive too deep into various models and modules. If you need more fine-grained control over the extraction itself, we recommend to use the python package directly and write your own Python script.

#### Python commands

To do this start by importing all the necessary components and instantiating a `thingsvision` extractor. Here we're using `AlexNet` from the `torchvision` library as the model to extract features from and also load the model to GPU for faster inference,

```python
import torch
from thingsvision import get_extractor
from thingsvision.utils.storing import save_features
from thingsvision.utils.data import ImageDataset, DataLoader

model_name = 'alexnet'
source = 'torchvision'
device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'

extractor = get_extractor(
  model_name=model_name,
  source=source,
  device=device,
  pretrained=True
)
```

As a next step, create both dataset and dataloader for your images. We assume that all of your images are in a single `root` directory which can contain subfolders (e.g., for individual classes). Therefore, we leverage the `ImageDataset` class. 

```python
root='path/to/root/img/directory' # (e.g., './images/)
batch_size = 32

dataset = ImageDataset(
  root=root,
  out_path='path/to/features',
  backend=extractor.get_backend(),
  transforms=extractor.get_transformations(resize_dim=256, crop_dim=224) # set input dimensionality to whatever is needed for your pretrained model
)

batches = DataLoader(
  dataset=dataset,
  batch_size=batch_size, 
  backend=extractor.get_backend()
)
```

Now all that is left is to extract the image features and store them to disk! Here we're extracting features from the last convolutional layer of AlexNet (`features.10`), but if you don't know which modules are available for a given model, just call `extractor.show_model()` to print all modules.

```python
module_name = 'features.10'

features = extractor.extract_features(
  batches=batches,
  module_name=module_name,
  flatten_acts=True  # flatten 2D feature maps from convolutional layer
)

save_features(features, out_path='path/to/features', file_format='npy')
```

_For more examples on the many models available in `thingsvision` and explanations of additional functionality like how to optionally turn off center cropping, how to use HDF5 datasets (e.g. NSD stimuli), how to perform RSA or CKA, or how to easily extract features for the [THINGS image database](https://osf.io/jum2f/), please refer to the [Documentation](https://vicco-group.github.io/thingsvision/)._
